# Multi-Object object detection

This repository is an exercise for the multi-object object detection project on the PASCAL-VOC 2012 Dataset.
The PASCAL-VOC 2012 contains 20 classes of natural objects. The train/val data has 11,530 images containing 27,450 ROI 
annotated objects and 6,929 segmentations.

Original dataset was downloaded from [http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/index.html](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/index.html).

# Overview

In this exercise, in order to solve the challenge of multi-object object detection in PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, two 
different networks have been used. 
### 1- An Innovative Model.

This model includes 10,276,493 parameters, 2,640,933 of which are trainable. The input size of this model is 
(256, 256, 3) and it is trained to 220 epochs.

The structure of the model is shown in the image below:

### 2- A model similar to SSD in which there are only convolutional layers of SSD.

This model includes 25,478,936 parameters, 10,764,248 of which are trainable. The input size of this model is 
(300, 300, 3) and it is trained to 300 epochs.

The structure of the model is shown in the image below:

***Both of these models uses anchor boxes for object detection problem***

These two networks have been trained in Google colab, and for their training, 80% of PASCAL data has been considered as train 
data and 20% of them as validation data.

loss curves for both models are shown in figure below:

## Usage

### Requirements

- python 3.9
- Tensorflow == 2.11.0
- pandas == 1.5.3
- numpy == 1.24.2
- matplotlib == 3.6.3
- keras~=2.11.0
- scikit-learn~=1.1.1
- lxml == 4.9.2

### Train

In order to train the innovative network, run file ***train_innovative_model.py*** and in order to train the SSD-Like
network, run file ***train_ssd_like_model.py***.

### Predict

In order to predict using the innovative network, run file ***prediction_innovative_model.py*** and in order to predict 
using the SSD-Like network, run file ***prediction_ssd_like_model.py***.

## TODO

Both of these models have a little problem of over-fitting, and the reason for that is not augmenting the data, which 
will be solved in the next versions.
